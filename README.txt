The necessary code to get this going is:

!create f1:FPS
!f1.initInstance()
!insert (Neutral1,f1) into firstPersonShooterState
!insert (Die1,f1) into firstPersonShooterState                                
!insert (Panic1,f1) into firstPersonShooterState
!insert (Attack1,f1) into firstPersonShooterState
